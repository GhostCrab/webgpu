# Project Documentation

This directory contains exploratory refactoring documentation, technical analysis, and implementation notes for the WebGPU Verlet Physics project.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation files are indexed numerically for easy reference and chronological tracking:

- **Format**: `XX_descriptive_name.md` where XX is a two-digit index (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Each document captures a specific refactoring task, architectural decision, or technical exploration
- **Intended Use**: These documents serve as context for future Claude Code sessions and as reference material for understanding the evolution of the codebase

## Index

1. [01_compute_refactor.md](./01_compute_refactor.md) - Compute shader architecture audit and refactoring exploration

## Usage for Claude Code Sessions

When starting a new conversation about this project, reference relevant documentation files to provide context about previous architectural decisions and implementation details. This helps maintain consistency and builds on prior work.

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Use the next available numeric index
2. Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with underscores
3. Update the Index section in this README
4. Include clear sections: Context, Analysis, Recommendations, and Implementation (if applicable)
